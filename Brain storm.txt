===Grey out vision==
A greyout (also whiteout) is a transient loss of vision characterized by a perceived dimming of light and color, sometimes accompanied by a loss of peripheral vision.[1] It is a precursor to fainting or a blackout and is caused by hypoxia (low brain oxygen level), often due to a loss of blood pressure.
Greyouts have a variety of possible causes:
-Shock, such as Hypovolemia, even in mild form such as when drawing blood.

-Suddenly standing up (see orthostatic hypotension), especially if sick, hungover, or suffering from low blood pressure.

-By pilots or roller coaster riders experiencing positive g-force.

-Paradoxically, hyperventilation, such as the fainting game, self-induced hypocapnia, or shallow water blackout.
-Overexertion

==Method for tests==
-Since it is a temporary thing it is hard to make tests unless forcing someone to experience a g-force?

-so solution might be to show a video and asks user if they share similar experience.
